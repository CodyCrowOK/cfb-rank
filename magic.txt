Note: This is not exactly how the program is implemented.

Magic formula:
Team score for a single game = (O-factor + D-factor) * X-factor * Win factor
Team score for a season = Average of all individual game scores * SOS

#X-factor = arctan(O-factor - D-factor)
abs(O-factor - D-factor)
X-factor = (1/e) * e^((-((1/100)*(abs(O-factor - D-factor))))^2) + 1

O-factor = ((rushing yards/carry * e^e) + (passing yards/attempt * e^2)) * arctan(total offensive yards)

3-rate = Opponent 3rd down conversion rate
3-factor = (e^arctan(1 - 3-rate)) - (1/e)
D-factor = ((1 / (rushing yards/carry) + 1) + (1 / (passing yards/attempt) + (e / 3))) * 3-factor

M-V = Score - Opponent's score (negatives allowed)
Win factor = e^arctan((M-V) / e^e)

SOS = .5 * arctan (e * (Opponent W-L)) + (2 / e)

e = Euler's number
