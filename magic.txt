Magic formula:
Team score for a single game = (O-factor + D-factor) * X-factor * Win factor
Team score for a season = Sum of all individual game scores * Opp W-L factor

X-factor = arctan(O-factor - D-factor)

O-factor = ((rushing yards/carry * e^e) + (passing yards/attempt * e^2)) * arctan(total offensive yards)


M-V = Score - Opponent's score (negatives allowed)
Win factor = e^arctan((M-V) / e^e)


e = Euler's number
